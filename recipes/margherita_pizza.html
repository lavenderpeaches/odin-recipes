    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>
        The Margherita pizza is a timeless Italian classic that celebrates simplicity and fresh ingredients. Its minimalist approach allows the quality of the components to shine through. A thin, crispy crust is the foundation for a generous layer of tangy tomato sauce, topped with the creamy goodness of mozzarella cheese.

        Fresh basil leaves, a vibrant green garnish, add a touch of herbaceousness to the pizza. Drizzled with a high-quality olive oil and sprinkled with sea salt, the Margherita pizza delivers a perfect balance of flavors and textures. It is a dish that embodies the essence of Italian cuisine: fresh, simple, and undeniably delicious.
